üöÄ What's next:

    1. Open a new terminal window
    2. Type:  gdump --edit
    3. Follow the prompts to add the Google Cloud Project(s) that you want to dump
       (yeah, you'll need those API keys üôÑ)

üí° Pro tip: Run 'gdump --schedule' to set up automatic dumps
    (because who wants to think about this more than once?)
